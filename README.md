# BestFit-MemoryAllocation
Implementation of the Best-Fit memory allocation algorithm in Java. Includes a console-based program to allocate memory blocks to processes based on the Best-Fit strategy.

This repository contains a Java implementation of the Best-Fit Memory Allocation Algorithm. The program allocates memory blocks to processes based on the Best-Fit strategy, where the smallest suitable block is chosen for a process.
